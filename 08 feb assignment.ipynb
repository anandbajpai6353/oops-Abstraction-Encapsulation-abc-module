    "Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on defining the essential characteristics and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to create simplified representations of real-world objects by breaking down complex systems into manageable modules. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces in most programming languages.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a car as an object. In an abstract sense, a car can be described by its properties (color, model, engine capacity) and behaviors (accelerate, brake, honk). However, the internal mechanisms and implementation details of the car's engine or transmission are not relevant at the abstract level. By abstracting the car object, we can focus on its essential characteristics and behaviors without getting bogged down in low-level details.\n",

    "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods/functions that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It combines the data and the operations on that data, providing data hiding and protection. Encapsulation allows for the organization and control of access to an object's internal state, preventing direct manipulation and ensuring data integrity.\n",

    "Data abstraction in programming refers to the concept of hiding internal details and complexity of data structures or objects and providing a simplified and consistent interface for interacting with them. It allows users to work with high-level concepts and operations without needing to understand the underlying implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several techniques to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes and Objects: Encapsulating data and behavior within classes and providing public methods to interact with the data is a fundamental way to achieve data abstraction. The class acts as a container for data attributes and methods, and the objects created from the class provide the interface for accessing and manipulating the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access Modifiers: Python does not have built-in access modifiers like public, private, or protected, but conventions are used to indicate the intended visibility of attributes and methods. By convention, attributes or methods starting with a single underscore (_) are considered internal or private to the class and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. This convention helps in achieving encapsulation and data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Property Decorators: Python provides property decorators (`@property`, `@<attribute>.setter`, `@<attribute>.deleter`) that allow you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for attributes. By using property decorators, you can control the access to attributes, perform validation or computation on attribute values, and provide a consistent interface for accessing and modifying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): As mentioned earlier, the `abc` module in Python allows you to define abstract base classes. Abstract base classes can define abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete subclasses. By defining abstract base classes, you can enforce a consistent interface across multiple subclasses and achieve data abstraction by focusing on the high-level behavior rather than the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Module-Level Functions: You can also achieve a level of data abstraction by organizing related functions within modules. By providing well-defined functions with clear inputs and outputs, you can encapsulate the complexity and hide the implementation details of the underlying algorithms or operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, achieving data abstraction involves encapsulating data and behavior within classes, controlling access to attributes, defining consistent interfaces through methods or functions, and hiding implementation details. By following these principles, you can create code that is easier to understand, maintain, and use by abstracting away unnecessary complexity."
